Developers for the longest time have dealt with the inner struggle of starting a side project and never finishing it - often stopping only after the first day. Balancing a full-time job or a personal life outside of code can be a difficult feat when you have the desire to build new projects every day. Finding the line of fulfilling your passion and nearing burnout is important in a developer's career.

I personally find myself struggling with even finding the motivation to start a side project knowing all these things. Knowing that it's likely the project halts after a week or even a day, or the fact that it's not likely that this project will even be seen by any other user then myself for a few days. It's preferred to find better reasons for working on side projects - like growing as a developer in your learning path - but there are so many times when I just have the urge to build something and be done with it.

This was the exact scenario I ran into with my project, **AirQueue**.

## The Origin of AirQueue

**AirQueue** is an idea that initially sparked into my head early on in my college days. I was pretty bored in most of my computer science classes at that time and was looking for a side project to work on to add to my portfolio for when I was looking for internships. The inspiration initially came from those digital jukebox radios you see in some bars and restaurant's where customers could pay to decide what music to play on the speakers.

I made an initial version of the project with my basic knowledge of JavaScript and Next.js that handled the core functionalities of the application:

- Registering a new account with **AirQueue** and authorizing it with your Spotify account.
- Start a "Live Session" in which other users can join with a code and optional password to begin searching songs to request.
- The host of the session can approve or deny incoming song requests from the other users, in which approved songs will be added to the host's live Spotify active queue.

For the little experience I had at that time in college, let alone Next.js, I was fairly impressed with my attempt at this project. I was able to get a successful version of it running and deployed through Vercel, and even used it on a few occasions with friends and family.

## Project Revival

The project naturally died out over time and was vaulted for quite a while, collecting dust on my GitHub. However; the idea never left my head, and I always brainstormed ideas for how I could make it better. At a certain point Spotify released a new feature that basically solved for all the use-cases of my idea, but I still had the urge to build it since I had put so much thought into it. I just never found the time.

Then came a weekend where I didn't have any plans outside of the normal chores and errands I had throughout the mornings. I found the right amount of time blocked away from responsibilities, mixed with the motivation to build something from scratch, and decided to go all out on a new version of **AirQueue**. I had put so much thought into the project over the past couple years or so, that all the product requirements and technical specs were already so engrained into my head that I was able to move at a much quicker speed.

I was able to almost treat it like a personal at-home hackathon where the prompt was a project that was never going to be seen by anybody except for myself.

## Lessons Learned

What I gained from this experience was invaluable: the realization that building a project—even when there’s no clear outcome or reward—can be incredibly fulfilling. Sometimes, it’s not about completing a project for others to use, but about getting all the ideas, frustrations, and thoughts out of your head and into something tangible. Much like journaling can help release emotional tension, coding can help release the technical tension in our minds.

Even though **AirQueue** may never reach the level of completion I initially envisioned, the process itself was valuable. The code I wrote and the lessons I learned are now stored in a GitHub repository, where I can reference them in the future. The project might never be seen by others, but it serves as a personal reminder of how far I’ve come, and what I’ve learned along the way.
