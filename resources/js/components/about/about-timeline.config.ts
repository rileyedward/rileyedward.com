            During my childhood years, I developed a deep curiosity for technology and problem-solving.
            I spent countless hours taking apart electronics and putting them back together,
            just to understand how they worked. This early fascination laid the groundwork for my
            future career in technology.

            My parents encouraged this curiosity, providing me with books, kits, and opportunities
            to learn more about the subjects that interested me. These formative years shaped my
            approach to learning and my desire to understand systems from the ground up.

            College was a transformative period where I honed my technical skills and discovered my
            passion for software development. I majored in Computer Science, but also took courses in
            design and business to develop a well-rounded perspective.

            During this time, I worked on several projects that combined my technical knowledge with
            creative problem-solving. I also participated in hackathons and coding competitions, which
            taught me how to work effectively under pressure and collaborate with diverse teams.

            Since graduating, I've been fortunate to work on a variety of challenging projects that have
            expanded my skills and perspective. I've specialized in web development, focusing on creating
            intuitive, accessible, and performant applications.

            I believe in continuous learning and regularly dedicate time to exploring new technologies and
            methodologies. Outside of work, I contribute to open-source projects and mentor aspiring
            developers, finding fulfillment in giving back to the community that has supported my growth.
