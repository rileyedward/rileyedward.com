            My journey into programming began in 2015 when I started experimenting with web development
            out of curiosity. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through online tutorials and
            personal experimentation, and quickly found myself drawn to the creativity and logic
            programming required.

            I later attended Missouri State University, where I continued honing my skills through
            personal and side projects while working as a web developer for the university. These
            hands-on experiences gave me valuable exposure to real-world codebases and laid the
            groundwork for the product-driven mindset I bring to my work today.

            I began my professional journey as a full-stack developer, primarily working with Laravel
            and Vue.js. I quickly gained real-world experience building production-grade applications
            that were performant, maintainable, and user-centric.

            During this time, I contributed to projects ranging from internal tools to customer-facing
            platforms, collaborating closely with designers and stakeholders. I learned how to architect
            scalable systems, write thoughtful code, and adapt quickly to evolving requirementsâ€”all while
            pushing myself to take on greater responsibility with each project.

            In 2024, I moved back to Kansas City to begin a new chapter in my career. I started at
            Empower Fresh, a local startup, where I contributed to a fast-moving product team and gained
            valuable experience in a lean, iterative environment while wearing multiple hats across
            development, DevOps, and customer success.

            After my time at Empower Fresh, I joined Active Logic, where I engineered sophisticated web
            applications for clients using cutting-edge technology stacks. I led critical components in
            innovative projects and collaborated effectively with cross-functional teams to deliver
            robust, scalable solutions.

            Currently, I'm at Schier Products as a Software Engineer II, developing and maintaining
            enterprise software solutions. I'm leveraging modern web technologies and collaborating with
            cross-functional teams to design, implement, and optimize applications that drive business
            efficiency and enhance customer experience.
