            My journey into programming began in 2015 when I started experimenting with web development
            out of curiosity. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through online tutorials and
            personal experimentation, and quickly found myself drawn to the creativity and logic
            programming required.

            I later attended Missouri State University, where I continued honing my skills through
            personal and side projects while working as a web developer for the university. These
            hands-on experiences gave me valuable exposure to real-world codebases and laid the
            groundwork for the product-driven mindset I bring to my work today.

            I began my professional journey as a full-stack developer, primarily working with Laravel
            and Vue.js. I quickly gained real-world experience building production-grade applications
            that were performant, maintainable, and user-centric.

            During this time, I contributed to projects ranging from internal tools to customer-facing
            platforms, collaborating closely with designers and stakeholders. I learned how to architect
            scalable systems, write thoughtful code, and adapt quickly to evolving requirements—all while
            pushing myself to take on greater responsibility with each project.

            In 2024, I moved back to Kansas City to begin a new chapter in my career. I started working
            for a local startup, where I was able to contribute to a fast-moving product team and gain
            valuable experience in a lean, iterative environment.

            Since then, I’ve transitioned into a role where I build custom applications from the ground
            up for clients—much like the work I loved doing early on. From initial planning to final
            deployment, I’m responsible for delivering full-stack solutions that are clean, scalable,
            and tailored to each project's goals. I'm still working mostly with Laravel, Vue, and Inertia,
            and constantly refining my approach to software that’s both beautiful and effective.
